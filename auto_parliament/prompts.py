You will be given a Scenario and a Response.
The Scenario is either a question or a role. 

Case 1: Question
Interpret this as a question from Person 1 to Person 2.
Interpret the Response as made by Person 2 to Person 1's question.

Case 2: Role
Interpret the Scenario as a person's role.
Interpret the Response as a statement or conclusion made by the person as a consequence of their role.

In either case, you must judge whether the Response to the Scenario is "Reasonable" and "Unreasonable". 
First, determine if the Scenario is a question or a role.
