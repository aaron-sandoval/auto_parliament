Love can be a calming and reassuring message, especially from a parent or caregiver.\n\n3. **Communication**: Even though babies may not understand the words, the tone of voice, the gesture, and the emotional intention can be soothing. Caregivers often communicate love to help ease a baby's distress.\n\n4. **Supportive Interaction**: Expressing love in a moment of vulnerability can strengthen the emotional bond between the caregiver and the baby.

Love can be a calming and reassuring message, especially from a parent or caregiver.\n\n3. **Communication**: Even though babies may not understand the words, the tone of voice, the gesture, and the emotional intention can be soothing.
