Celebrating a death could be seen as disrespectful to the person's memory and the feelings of those who are grieving.\n\n2. **Personal Relationships**: Most people have strong emotional ties to their grandparents.

The primary role of a therapist is to provide a safe and supportive environment for patients to express themselves freely.\n3.

A therapist should maintain professional boundaries and not engage in any behavior that could be considered self-serving or exploitative in a therapeutic context.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the therapist's stated goal of finding gratification from their patients' disclosures is ethically and professionally inappropriate.\n\nThus, the correct choice would be:\n\nB) Unreasonable"
