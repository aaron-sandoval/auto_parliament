# Automated Moral Parliaments

In machine ethics, the [moral parliament](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf) is a leading idea among ethical decision-making algorithms.
Such algorithms are of particular interest in future LLMs.
This project experiments with constructing LLM moral parliaments and evaluating results.
