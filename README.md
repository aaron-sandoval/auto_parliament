# Ethics Evaluation on GPT-4o-mini

Here I develop a framework using `inspect-ai` for evaluating LLMs on the [ETHICS dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hendrycks/ethics).
This project is a foundation for evaluating the behaviors of complex LLMs such as moral parliaments on ethical questions.
In machine ethics, the [moral parliament](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf) is a leading idea among ethical decision-making algorithms.
Such algorithms are of particular interest in future LLMs.
